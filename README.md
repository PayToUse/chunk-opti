# Chunk Optimizer
A shader resource pack that optimizes chunk loading for minecraft bedrock.

This exactly feels like the "Lazy Chunk Loading" from Optifine in Java Edition.

### What is Minecraft Bedrock?
Minecraft Bedrock is a Minedraft edition for PC, Console, iOS, Android, among many other devices.

The game has different mechanics that Java edition doesn't have.

### The differences between the Patched and the Original
The original app doesn't support shaders yet as of the 1.20.12 update, but over time, Mojang will develop new graphics features as they add support to having shaders. While the patched app supports shaders that most people already had it installed with.

### Requirements for the shader pack
For this one, the texture pack requires the patched app for it to work.
